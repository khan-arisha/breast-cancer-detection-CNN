# breast-cancer-detection-CNN

Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurately identifying and categorizing breast cancer subtypes is an important clinical task, and automated methods can be used to save time and reduce error.

 In this project, we tried to identify if the patient has IDC or not by using CNN.

We created a Tensorflow model that classifies breast tissue as containing Breast Cancer specifically Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) or not.
